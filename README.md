# Horarios-Grupo

This is a really simple web application designed to help groups coordinate their availability. Users can select their available time periods, submit them with a group code and name, and check the best time for the group to meet.

This application was inspired by an initial concept from @MelnikAndres, and has been built to provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience of it.
